Notes
-----
Numerous people sent me the fix for the Q3A master query problem.  I
think the first was Ted Milker, but thanks to all for your suggestions
and patience.

The Half-Life master support wasn't using the latest protocol, so
needed an upgrade.  Now you can get the full 2100+ server list from
the master.  BTW, there are more HL servers than Q3A servers.

Unreal support was changed to automatically add one to the port number
to find the query port.  This is probably why people thought QStat
didn't support UT.  For those that figure it out already, you'll have
to remove your own +1 hacks to use this release.

I apologize for the long delay between releases.  Work, holidays, and
health problems cut my free time to less than zero.

Best wishes for the new millennium,

Steve
