QStat Version 2.1y BETA
Aug 22, 1998

[ This text can also be found in CHANGES.txt in the release. ]


Summary of New Features
-----------------------
HexenWorld support
Revived support for id's Q2 master
New variables for output templates
Faster host cache initialization
More efficient server query (Unix only)
Support for AIX 4.2 and HPUX 11.0


Bug Fixes
---------
Fixed bogus query failure on second server on same IP address.
Fixed to ignore QW and Q2 server packets that contain lots of error
	messages.  Also disabled printing of the "Odd packet" messages.
	They can be enabled with the -errors option.
Fixed output templates on Windows

Non-feature
-----------
Unreal support.  Unreal needs to get fixed before QStat can support it.


HexenWorld support
------------------
Use the -hws command line option, or the HWS server type key.

Revived support for id's Q2 master
----------------------------------
id's Quake II master server was broken for a long time.  QStat
supported id's Q2 master, but the master only rarely returned anything
(and you had to wait up to 30 seconds for a response).  When QuakeSpy
announced that id had fixed their Q2 master, I was surprised that QStat
did not work on the fixed master.  Turns out the "fix" also changed the
query protocol slightly.

New variables for output templates
----------------------------------
General variables
$\		Inhibit output of the next newline.

Server template variables
$HEXENWORLD	True if the server is HexenWorld (use with $IF)
$UNREAL		True if the server is Unreal (use with $IF)

Player template variables
$DEATHS		Number of deaths (Unreal only)
$TEAMNUM	Team number (Unreal only)

un-Unreal support
-----------------
I implemented support for the original Unreal server status protocol.
However, the Unreal server worked so poorly as to be unusable.  Unreal
is getting improved Internet support, but it's not ready yet.  When
Unreal gets fixed, QStat will support the new protocol.


I've also included the templates I use for the status page of my
own Quake II servers.
