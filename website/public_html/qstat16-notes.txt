QStat Version 1.6

** UPDATED for 1.6 **
Nov 30, 1997

Changes since beta5.  Minor enhancements and a few fixes.

- Removed all the annoying copyright restrictions.
- Added option -ne : no empty servers
	Thanks secabeen@fnord.rh.uchicago.edu
- Added option -raw-arg : special for QStatList (see qstat docs)
	Thanks darkgrue@iname.com
- Added option -timeout : total time in seconds before giving up
	Can prevent overlapping runs when cron runs qstat every five
	minutes.
- Added gamedir to QW server output (not -raw)
- Fixed bug getting long server lists from QuakeWorld masters.  Can now
  get lists in excess of 16,000 servers.  How long til that limit is
  exceeded?
- Fixed bug using -H with -qw
- Fixed use of select() so systems with large file descriptor limits
  can query more than 64 servers at a time.

QStat 1.6 has been in alpha / beta just short of a year (1.6 alpha
was released Dec 20, 1996).  It has been a good year.  Many thanks
to those who sent suggestions, kind words, and bug reports.  And
appologies to those who have not seen their request implemented,
or who did not even receive a reply.

  "That's right, Kenny, Steve is a busy guy and doesn't care about
   your stupid problems."
  "Merfgl! gumerfm rerfgmmf!"
  "Dammit, Kenny, turn down the computer, I can't hear you over the
   splattering bodies."
  "Gumerfm rerfgmmf."
  "Oh.  Kenny says, Steve does care about your problems, but not the
   stupid ones."
  [ A large core dump falls on Kenny, killing him. ]
  "Steve killed Kenny!  You bastard!"

Quake II gives me an excuse to crank up the major version dial.
QStat 2.0 will feature support for Quake II servers.
