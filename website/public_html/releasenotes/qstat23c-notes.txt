QStat version 2.3c BETA
May 3, 1999

A slew of bug reports arrived over the weekend.  I guess QStat users
are weekend warriors.  Thanks to the four people that sent patches for
the Q3 master breakage.  I won't say who's patch I used, but I
selected the most elegant.

id has said that the Q3 master protocol will be changing alot over
the next weeks.  I'll try to track their progress, but no promises.
They also asked for suggestions on reducing packet size, so I sent
them my ideas (all quite clever <puff> <puff>).

Summary of Fixes
----------------
Q3 master server
Q3 server name
Tribes -raw mode [forgot to write it]
Removed leftover debug print
Switched snprintf() to sprintf() [much more portable]
Half-Life game rules [useful for TFC]
Fixed -progress output
Added player ping to Unreal player output
Fixed minor mistakes in docs
