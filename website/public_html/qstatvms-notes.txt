This patch is for OpenVMS Alpha systems.  It was tested with DEC C V5.6-003
on OpenVMS Alpha V7.1.  It should work on OpenVMS Alpha V7.0.  OpenVMS V6.2
and below doesn't support "h_errno" so you will have to comment out the
affected chunks of code.  I have no idea if will work on OpenVMS VAX.

I don't care what anybody says.  VMS rules! :)
