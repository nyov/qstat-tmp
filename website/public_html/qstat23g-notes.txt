QStat version 2.3g
Feb 18, 2000


BETA is done!  The 2.3 release is stable enough now to drop the
beta qualifier.

Summary of New Features
-----------------------
Added options to support Soldier of Fortune [-sfs]

New template variables
----------------------
$IF:SOLDIEROFFORTUNE

There are command-line options to control the following, but it's
handy to have control within the templates as well.
$COLORNUMBERS		Set the format of $SHIRTCOLOR and $PANTSCOLOR
$COLORNAMES
$COLORRGB
$TIMESECONDS		Set the format of $CONNECTTIME
$TIMECLOCK
$TIMESTOPWATCH

Summary of Fixes
----------------
Fix crashes in Unreal -raw player output (duh).
Fix hangs doing Unreal server queries.
Fix $GAME for Quake 3 servers
Fix Kingpin servers reported as Q2 servers

Notes
-----
The SOF server does not return map information, so you'll just get a
'?' or blank for an SOF map.  The map info is returned by the master
server.  But QStat does not yet support the SOF master server.  I
traced the SOF master protocol, but it's totally different from any
other master server.  Before I invest the time into writing a
parser for the SOF master packets, I'm going to wait to see if it
changes before the final retail release.

Notes on Future Releases
------------------------
Now that the 2.3 release train is winding down, what's up for
QStat 2.4?  I don't know, but there's a few frequently requested
features:
 - More sort options; server and player
 - More games; Delta Force, Descent III
 - Fetch server lists from web pages
 - Better templates; variables and full expression evaluation
 - Better performance on large server lists
 - Examples and samples

I don't know which features will be available when, so don't ask.

There may be one or two more 2.3 releases to fix critical bugs or
add a new game.

Getränk und ist fröhlich,
