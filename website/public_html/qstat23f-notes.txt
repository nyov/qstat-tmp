Summary of Fixes
----------------
Added player ping and face to Unreal -raw output
Fix queries for version 405 Unreal servers

New template variable
---------------------
For the player template:
$FACE       The texture used on a player's face.
            This was added to Unreal a while back, but I didn't notice.

Notes
-----
The fine blokes at Unreal decided to fiddle with the Unreal query
protocol.  When asked why PingTool and QStat did not work with the
new servers, they responded that we must not be following the new
GameSpy spec.  Ha!  As if they publish this information or care to
keep other server browser authors informed.  Sheesh.
