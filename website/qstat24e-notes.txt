QStat version 2.4e
Oct 1, 2001

This release is basically to fix Tribes 2 support.  That was all my
fault, Dynamix/Sierra did nothing wrong.  Since I was going through
the trouble of a full release, I decided to toss in Descent 3 support.
Don't be impressed, a patch for D3 was sitting in my inbox.  :-)

Many thanks to Matthew Mueller for a patch to support Descent 3.
Matthew thanks Brian Hayes, Kevin Bentley, and tcpdump.
Thanks to Thomas Hager for putting me on the right track for the

Sorry, the real -noconsole support did not make it into this release.
