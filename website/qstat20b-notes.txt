QStat Version 2.0b
Dec 29, 1997

- Fix map name for Quake II 3.07-09
  The rule key changed from "map" to "mapname".  If both are present,
  then "mapname" takes precedence.
- Q2: Noticed some servers are running custom games.  The rule keys for
  games are confusing:
	"gamename"	Always seems to be set to "baseq2", unless a
			custom game is being run, in which case "gamename"
			is not set at all.
	"gamedir"	Probably the same as "*gamedir" in QW.
	"game"		Always the same as "gamedir" in the servers I
			stat'd.  Maybe this can be used to indicate the
			name as well as the version of the game being
			run.
  For now, QStat displays the value of the "game" key in the non-raw
  output of Q2 servers.
- Print file name and line number information with errors when reading
  files.
- new option: -progress    display progress meter

Leave for the Holidays and the id boys change the protocol.  A minor
change, but a few QStat users noticed right away.  The change does
not affect people using -raw.
