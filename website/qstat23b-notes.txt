QStat version 2.3b BETA
April 29, 1999

New: Quake III and BFRIS support
Not many complaints about problems with 2.3a, looks like the
new code is working fine.

Summary of New Features
-----------------------
Quake III: Arena (Q3Test)
Quake III master
BFRIS (www.aegistech.com)

Minor Changes
-------------
A couple people pointed out that the docs and the code did not
exactly agree on the server type strings.  So, I've fixed the
code to match the docs.  The following type strings were changed:

2.3a            2.3b
----            ----
QW	-->	QWS
Q2 	-->	Q2S

Notes
-----
Voluminous thanks to Dave "Zoid" Kirsch of id Software for supplying
diffs to support Quake III.  Zoid says has used QStat "from time to time"
over the years.  Makes me smile.

And a sweeping bow to Pete Ratzlaff of Harvard for the diff to support
Linux game BFRIS.  See www.aegistech.com for info.

I gave the diffs the wary eye for fuggly programming, but both were
written nicely and applied without a hitch.  I performed minimal
testing of the new code, please let me know if there are problems.
