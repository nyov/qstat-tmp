<font color=yellow><b>QStat 2.5b</b></font> - NEW RELEASE!<br>
        Sorry! I broke XQF with an innocent little addition to the -raw output 
        format. This release reverts the changes to raw output, but adds an option 
        to enable the new extra information. You can <a href="qstatdl.html">download</a>

<font color=yellow><b>QStat 2.5a</b></font> - NEW RELEASE!<br>
All my babbling in the July 15 update has paid off.  The new release
is available for <a href="qstatdl.html">download</a>.  The level
of internal beta testing was pretty good, so I decided to skip a
public beta test.
<p>
Tons of good features in this release.  Check out the 
<a href="qstat25a-notes.txt">release notes</a>
for a high density summary.  Here's the highlights:
<li>Config file support - Add a new game type to QStat without re-compiling!
<li>SOF2 support for servers and masters (all versions)
<li>Server rule template with rule value equality tests
<li>Improved Half-Life status info
<li>Lots of bug fixes
        <li>Artistic License - This version of QStat is released under the Artistic 
          License. See LICENSE.txt in the QStat package for the license terms.

        <b>July 15, 2002 - 8:12 pm</b><br>
I've been getting email recently wondering if QStat has been
abandoned.  Don't worry, I haven't been totally idle.  I did some
work on QStat back in March, but discovered that QStat users had
created a compatibility problem for me.  Some have extended the QStat
game types into their own system.  That's fine, but the systems
used different type strings for the same game type.  For example,
XQF used one string for Star Trek: Elite Force, but Server Query
uses a different string.  If I add support for ST:EF, which type
string do I use?
<p>
I thought about this problem and I thought about the future of
QStat and realized there was a bigger problem to solve.  Game types
need to be customizable and user defined.  Users should be able
to configure the game types including type string, game name,
default port, and maybe even request packets.
<p>
The next version of QStat, in beta test now, will support a QStat
configuration file.  This is a simple text file that QStat reads
at start up.  In it you can define your own game types as extensions
of an existing game type (usually Q3S or GPS).  You can even set the
request packet so you can query games that require non-standard
requests.  QStat must still know how to interpret the response packet,
but most games use similar packet formats.
<p>
The config file turned out to be very flexible and should prove useful
for other purposes.  QStat will ship with a default config file that
includes support for Soldier of Fortune 2 1.0 and 1.01, Medal of Honor:AA
(both gamespy and Q3 style protocols) and Command&Conquer: Renegade.
I'll add others if more examples are needed, but I expect y'all will
make your own config files and go your own way.
        <p> Thanks for waiting. Hopefully you won't need to wait for me so much in the 
          future. I hope to have a public beta available in a couple weeks. <br>

<b>Tip of The Day</b> - To get a Quake 3 server list for the latest
version of Quake 3 (1.27g), use the following:<pre>
    qstat -q3m,48 master3.idsoftware.com
</pre>
The key is to add the ",48" after the type option.  This is the
protocol version that corresponds to latest version of Quake 3.
The next version of QStat will use "48" as the default.

        April 11, 2001 - 4:41 pm</b><br>
After five years and 30 versions, QStat gets its own domain!
I'm so excited.  I think I'll celebrate by releasing a new
version.  Soon.  I promise.
<p>
<b>Historical Facts of Great Accuracy</b><br>
<blockquote>
<li>QStat 1.0 was released on Sunday, March 31 1996.  I think it only
supported qtest, but it's hard to tell.  The docs don't say because
there was only one multi-player Internet shooter in existence at
the time.  It was Quake or nothing.  I didn't realize the five
year anniversary of QStat had come and gone.  The traditional gift
for a fifth anniversary is wood.  Given all the furniture I've been
buying lately, I'd appreciate gift certificates from Crate and Barrel
or Restoration Hardware.  :-)
<li>The first release of QStat was just 301 lines of code.  The
latest version crests 7500 lines.
<li>QStat has been downloaded <b>alot</b>.  Sadly, I don't have
good web stats for the qstat site.  A couple years ago, QStat was
getting 1000+ downloads a month.  Given the arcane nature of
QStat, I think most people say "Huh?" after unzipping it, and
drag it to the trash.  But, based on the amount of email I get
from around world, there's plenty of successful QStat users.
<li>I'm most proud of how <a href="http://www.theclq.com">The Champions League for Quake</a> has
used QStat.  They track player and server statistics for
350,000 servers and over 13 million players.  All the raw data
for their system comes from QStat.

Wow, that was fast.  Gamespy master authentication was reenabled.
QStat can no longer retrieve server lists from Gamespy masters.  Oh well,
I expected as much.  Queries against "gamespy protocol" servers
(<tt>-gps</tt>) will still work.  But you'll have to go else where
for your server lists.  Here's the email I received from Gamespy:
<blockquote>
<small>
As you appear to have noticed, we turned off validation on our master server
a few months ago after a release of GameSpy that had a bug in its
authentication code (we didn't want to deny those users access).
<p>
This authentication has now been turned back on, and thus the version of
QStat you released will no longer be able to retrieve lists of servers from
our master.
<p>
I'm sorry we had to do this - it's certainly nothing against qstat - it's
just that our master server is a major investment in time and money (if you
saw our bandwidth bills you'd understand) and as such we reserve it for the
use of GameSpy clients and other companies that pay reasonable licensing 
fees.
<p>
Thanks - and if you have any question about GameSpy games in the future
please let me know.

The next release of QStat is ready to go, but I don't have access

server queries will be fixed.  I'm also working on fixing the
Half-Life master queries, but the masters aren't cooperating.  I'm
waiting on help from a server-browser author on that front.
Also, query flags have been added for Kingpin and Heretic II.
(they were previously supported via <tt>-q2s</tt>).  QStat already
supports Unreal Tournament via <tt>-uns</tt>. I don't plan any special

Thanks to the several people who wrote in to tell me that the

But id changed the master server protocol shortly there after.
Never fear, a couple QStat regulars and some new blood figured it
out and sent patches.
<p>
I'm also aware of the portability problems introduced by
<tt>snprintf()</tt>.  This was added by the BFRIS code and was
actually new to me.  Rather than delay the release of Q3
support, I got it compiling on NT, Solaris, and Linux.  But,
my Solaris box is 2.6.  On 2.5/2.5.1, <tt>snprintf()</tt> doesn't exist.
But, as Dark Grue points out, it does exist as <tt>__snprintf()</tt>.

He notes that the port number used for Turok2 server queries is the

I wasn't paying attention, but there's been a shake down among
the Internet Quake server lists.

QuestGate                       Gone.

The PlanetQuake list seems to be up, but my browser doesn't display
anything after downloading a 400k list.  On the bright side, I received
note from <a href="http://quake.org.pl">quake.org.pl</a> editor
<a href="mailto:tryllu@quake.org.pl">Tryllu</a> that the
<a href="http://quake.org.pl/serwery">Polish server
list</a> is up and tracking Kielbasa fraggers.
<p>
<i>Cue insightful analysis.</i>  The use of master servers and GameSpy
have made web server lists largely obsolete.  What the community needs
now is global statistics gathering.  There are an inordinate number of
servers and players on the Internet, but no one's tracking usage.
At the moment (6:30 pm, PDT), there are 3837 players on 1656 running
servers.  And that's just Quake II, there's also 1781 players on 870
QuakeWorld servers.  5500 twitching fingers is pretty good, perhaps
enough to attract more attention to on-line gaming, and hence bring
in more players.
<p>
Anyone working on global usage stats for Quake and other shooters?
I'd do the work myself, but my company keeps me way too busy.  One
technical impediment is the lack of a good graphing utility
suitable for automated scripting.  Excel makes great graphs, but
it's costly and automation via VBScript or some such monstrosity is
not my idea of a good time.  If you have ideas, please send them
to me.  I'll aggregate and post. - <a href="mailto:steve@qstat.org">Steve</a>

ARG!  The output template stuff in 2.1z doesn't quite work on Windows.
The bug is caused by an idiosynchrasy in the Windows handling of
&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt; during file reads.  I'll have a fix in a day or
two, but in the mean time there is a work-around.
<pre>   Remove the carriage returns from the template files.  You'll
   need to remove all &lt;cr&gt; characters, but leave the &lt;lf&gt; chars.
   &lt;cr&gt; is hex D or control-M.  &lt;lf&gt; is hex A or control-J.
   The template files in the qstat tar file do not have &lt;cr&gt; chars.
</pre>
Version 6.2 of <a href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a> will
extract <tt>.tar.gz</tt> files, so download
<a href="qstat21z.tar.gz">qstat21z.tar.gz</a> and extract
the template files with WinZip.
<p>This bug got through because I only tested with Unix-based template
files.   Sorry for the inconvenience.

claims:<br>

<font size=-1 color=#ffba90>
GStat is a work based upon QStat ... In addition, it is faster than
QStat for certain aspects of querying servers, has more options (all of
them useful, naturally) and is much less bug-prone.
</font></br></br>
I think the glove has been thrown down :) "bug-prone"?  Ok, QStat 1.6 was
buggy for a real long time, but I have only one outstanding bug in
QStat 2.0 and it's actually a Solaris bug.  Please tell me if you know
of others.
I'm not going in the same direction with QStat as Aaron, and only wish
the best for a fellow programmer. <br><br>
Here is what I'm working on for QStat 2.1:<br>
<UL type=square>
<li>Host name/IP address cache (faster lookups and -H processing)
<li>Output templates.  Create a template web page and QStat will
fill in the server information where you want it.  Doesn't have to
be a web page, but that's the most likely usage.
<li>Server and player sorting.  Handy for web pages.
<li>Some performance improvements (though nothing dramatic).
