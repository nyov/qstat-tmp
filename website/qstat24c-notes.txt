Summary of New Features
-----------------------
Tribes 2 player type and tribe tag information
Changed Quake 3 default version to "48" (1.27g)
New Tribes 2 master filters. (see documentation)

Bug Fixes
---------
Fixed win32/qstat.exe binary; re-compiled using old compiler
Convert newlines into spaces when printing Tribes 2 server info
    in raw mode.
Fixed problems with the 22337 build of Tribes 2.
Tribes 2 raw output is now the same format as most other servers.
    Note that this reverses the order of current and max players
    from what they were in 2.4b.  And adds ping and # retries values.

New template variables
----------------------
$IF:ISBOT
$IF:ISALIAS
$IF:TRIBETAG
$TRIBETAG

Notes
-----
	[ Blarg, I hate it when I blow a release.  Many people had
	  problems with the win32/qstat.exe in 2.4b release.  I had
	  compiled this with a new compiler version on a new Win2k
	  install.  It worked fine for me, but apparently the new
	  compiler has compatibility problems.  So, I've gone back
	  to the old compiler and old NT 4.0 install.
	  Several people also reported problems using 2.4b with the
	  new 22337 build of Tribes 2.
	  Sorry about the problems.  This release should fix things
	  up. ]

The new Tribes 2 player info is available in raw mode (see docs) and
templates.  But it is not displayed in the interactive output.  I've
updated the sample Tribes 2 templates to display the new player info.

Finally, there seem to be a number of bugs with the Tribes 2 master
servers.  One of the bugs is noted in the documentation.  Dynamix is
aware of the problems and working to fix them.
