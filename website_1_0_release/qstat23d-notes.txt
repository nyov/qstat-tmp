Quake 3 master
--------------
The id Q3 master server isn't working very well.  The protocol is lame
and its network is way over subscribed.  I've enhanced QStat to deal
with the changes, but I actually think they (id) have made matters worse
rather than better.  QStat can now, sometimes, get all the servers
from the master, but it often can't get 30-60% of the servers.  This
is not QStat problem, but id's.  I've sent them a detailed analysis
of the problems and made some suggestions.

Summary of Fixes
----------------
Improve reliability of Q3 master server queries
Support Tribes servers with 3+ teams
Strip escape sequences from Q3 player names; use -hpn if you want the
	complete content of player names.
Accurately calculate number of servers on a master (ignore duplicates).
Fixed $(ISFULL) to be false if the server is empty [duh]

New Features
------------
New option to control master server retry interval ("-mi") independent
	of server retry interval.
Increase maximum -maxsim to 256 for Win32.
Added $(TYPESTRING) template var; shows server's type string (eg. q2s, hls)
Added $(NOWINT) template var; shows the current time in seconds since
	00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970.
