QStat version 2.2a is available at:

Not too much in this release, but I've been getting an email a day
asking about Half-Life support.  The Half-Life status packets are
totally different from Quake II, so I've only completed the general
info so far.  Players and rules from Half-Life will be available in the
next release.  I also threw in flags to support Sin.  Sin was
supported in previous releases by pretending it was a Q2 server, but
now it has its own flags.

Future releases of QStat will support even more games (Shogo, Blood 2,
Heretic 2, etc).
