<h1 align=right>Using QStat with a Web Page</h1>

<p>I get lots of questions about how to put <a href="qstat.html">QStat</a>
on a web page.
This can be done one of two ways.  Have a program run periodically
that creates a new web page based on the output of QStat.  Or run
a script or program when someone loads your page.  The first style
can be done on existing operating systems, but requires that
you be able to run a program on the web server, even when you
aren't on-line.  Most ISPs don't allow this.</p>
<p>The second style involves web programming, also known as CGI programming.
I've never done any CGI programming, so I can't offer specific help.</p>

<p>The <a href="qderived.html">QStat Derived Works</a> page lists a
couple packages that help turn QStat output into HTML.</p>

<p>I've done a little research and found several web pages with
CGI programming tutorials.  Good luck!</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://qhtml.telefragged.com/index.shtml">Qhtml</a>
<p>And excellent resource for developers creating Quake
related web-sites.  Links for all the general web development
tasks as well as links to Quake specific tools.  Oddly, they
don't list QStat.  But the site seems abandoned.

<li><a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">The Common Gateway Interface</a>
<p>A complete straight-forward guide to CGI and all its features.  Does
not describe how to make a web server use your CGI program.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/cgi/">CGI Made Really Easy</a>
<p>A nice simple primer on CGI programming.  Focuses on the use of
forms based pages.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.mcp.com/zdpress/features/3970/">CGI Manual of Style</a>
<p>An entire on-line book about CGI.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/CGI___Common_Gateway_Interface/">Yahoo CGI category</a>
<p>References to <b>lots</b> of CGI information pages, mostly non-commercial.</p>

<h2>QStat features for web pages</h2>

<h4>Output Templates</h4>
QStat can generate custom formatted output using templates.  This
is ideal for generating web pages.  The template/ directory in
the QStat distribution includes some examples.  The examples are
admittedly poor, but they should get you started.  The QStat
docs provide full details on the output template syntax.

<h4>Raw mode</h4>

<p>The QStat <tt><b>-raw</b></tt> flag is intended for use by
server-side web programmers (ie. perl).  Adding the flag
<tt><b>-raw</b> <i>delimeter</i></tt> to your
qstat command causes the output fields to be separated by
<tt><i>delimeter</i></tt>.  Try the command by hand to see how it
works.
To avoid conflicts between your delimiter and similar characters in
server and player names, use a multi-character delimiter.
Complete details on the <tt><b>-raw</b></tt> flag and related flags
can found in the <a href="qstatdoc.html">QStat documentation</a>.
