Version 1.6 beta5
 
** UPDATED for 1.6 beta5 **
Oct 5, 1997
 
Kitchen sink release to add some of the most requested features.
 
- Extended file format.  The file used with the -f option can include
  server type information to distinguish between Hexen II, Quake, and
  QuakeWorld servers.  You can put all your servers into one file and
  query them all with one qstat invocation.
- Fix bug that caused a QuakeWorld master server query to never timeout.
- New option -h2s for specifying a single Hexen II server to query.
- New option -maxsimultaneous limits the number of simultaneous server
  queries.  Previously configurable by modifying the MAXFD #define in
  qstat.h.
- Updated docs [FINALLY!]
- Compiles on HP-UX 10.20
- Changed packaging: files are in a directory named for the version
  of qstat, and use gzip instead of compress on unix
- Removed pre-QuakeWorld 1.5 support.  The -qw1.5 option is obsolete
  and no longer needed.  As are the -qwuserinfo and -qwseeninfo options.
- Smarter about when to include server type prefix in formatted output
 
Unless I hear cries for more features, this will be the last beta
before the final release of qstat 1.6.  Now that the docs are up to
date, I've run out of excuses for doing the release.
