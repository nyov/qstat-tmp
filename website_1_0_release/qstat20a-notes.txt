QStat Version 2.0a
Dec 9, 1997
 
- Support for Quake II servers, see documentation for usage.
- Minor fix to connect time formatting.
 
I don't have Quake II, but the status protocol is very similar to
QuakeWorld, so I was able to figure it out by poking existing Quake II
servers on the net.  Id has stated that the network protocol will
get an upgrade soon after the in-store release.  As always, QStat
will track these changes as they become available.
